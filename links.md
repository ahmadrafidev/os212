really help me out with C programming syntax and stuff.

## W03

[Nano](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/)\

Logical and physical addresses in OS for memory management.

[Difference Between Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](http://www.meerutcollege.org/mcm_admin/upload/1587052623.pdf)\
The differences between logical and physical address in OS.

[Dynamic Memory Allocation and Fragmentation in C and C++](https://www.design-reuse.com/articles/25090/dynamic-memory-allocation-fragmentation-c.html)\
In C and C++, it can be very convenient to allocate and de-allocate blocks of memory as and when needed. This is certainly standard practice in both languages and almost unavoidable in C++. However, the handling of such dynamic memory can be problematic and inefficient. For desktop applications, where memory is freely available, these difficulties can be ignored. For embedded - generally real time - applications, ignoring the issues is not an option.

[Introduction to Memory Management](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/mac/pdf/Memory/Intro_to_Mem_Mgmt.pdf)\
This chapter is a general introduction to memory management on Macintosh computers.
It describes how the Operating System organizes and manages the available memory,
and it shows how you can use the services provided by the Memory Manager and other
system software components to manage the memory in your application partition.

[Pointers and Arrays](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/817-6223/chp-pointers/index.html)\
Pointers are memory addresses of data objects in the operating system kernel or in the address space of a user process.
