# OS TIPS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM AHMAD RAFI

## Tips number one: Don't cheating
That's it. That's the tips.

## Suggestion number one: PLS UPLOAD the record so the student can learn on our own
Sometimes, student not in the mood to learn via zoom, so they rewatch the recording
from SCELE and that is very effective because we learn because we want to. GSGS is good,
but zoom recording is great.

## Tips number two: GSGS is your way
I think GSGS to finishing OS assignment is the best way to learn our own because
when you google "something" you will get another material that connected to
material you want to get.

## Suggestion number two: I think in class lecturer must explain what is "that" rather than showing step to finishing assignment
Although gsgs is good, I think lecturer must explain material with your own way or style because I am myself as a student need
some kind of guidance from the "master" itself and gsgs is not supported that kind of guidance.
