# OS TIPS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM AHMAD RAFI

## Tips number one: Don't cheating
That's it. That's the tips.

## Suggestion number one: PLS UPLOAD the record so the student can learn on our own
Sometimes, student not in the mood to learn via zoom, so they rewatch the recording
from SCELE and that is very effective because we learn because we want to. GSGS is good,
but zoom recording is great.

## Tips number two: GSGS is your way
I think GSGS to finishing OS assignment is the best way to learn our own because
when you google "something" you will get another material that connected to
material you want to get.

## Suggestion number two: I think in class lecturer must explain what is "that" rather than showing step to finishing assignment
Although gsgs is good, I think lecturer must explain material with your own way or style because I am myself as a student need
some kind of guidance from the "master" itself and gsgs is not supported that kind of guidance.

## Tips number three: FINISH THE JOB.
Finish the assignment as soon as possible. The reason to do this is very simple: to make your mind clear and you can
continue playing games or do something else.

## Suggestion number three: Make class more interactive, oncam is a MUST!
I think because the class go online, some student don't appreciate the presence of lecturer. So make every class oncam
is one of a ways to make student respect lecturer more.

## Tips number four: Read Text Book and do Demos
read the book material and do demos is making your ways to get the maximal output of OS things.

## Suggestion number four: Detail is important!
In OS assignment, you will face more step by step to finish assignment and the step is connected to one another. So be detail
because if you past one step, you will or must to take the first step again.
