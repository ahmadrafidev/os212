# OS TIPS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM AHMAD RAFI

## Tips number one: Don't cheating
That's it. That's the tips.

## Suggestion number one: PLS UPLOAD the record so the student can learn on our own
Sometimes, student not in the mood to learn via zoom, so they rewatch the recording
from SCELE and that is very effective because we learn because we want to. GSGS is good,
but zoom recording is great.
